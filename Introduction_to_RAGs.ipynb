Since its formation in 1787, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has  \\nbeen  recognised  as the sole authority  for drawing  up the Code  and for all subsequent  \\namendments.  The Club  also holds  the World  Copyright.  \\n \\nThe basic Laws of Cricket have stood the test of time remarkably  well.  While the game has \\nevolved over generations, it remains recognisably the same sport as in decades and centuries \\ngone by. The Laws today may be longer and more complex than the earliest Codes in the \\n18th Century, but they retain the same central core , and often some of the same language. It \\nis thought that one of the real reasons for this sustainability is not just the appeal of cricket as \\na sport, but also that cricketers have traditionally been prepared to play in the Spirit of the  \\nGame,  recognised  in the  Preamble since  2000,  as well as in accordance with the  Laws.  \\n \\nThat said, the game does evolve, and the Laws must do so with it. The changes made in the \\n2017 Code – of which this is the third edition - reflected views following a global \\nconsultation with players, umpires and administrators at all levels of the game, including the \\nInternational  Cricket Council, the sport’s global governing body.  The game ha d evolved \\nquickly, requiring six Editions of the 2000 Code to be published in only fifteen years.  A new \\nCode was  necessary to rationalise these amendments and to list the Laws in a more logical \\nformat and  order.  The guiding objectives behind the 2017 changes, evidenced from the \\nconsultation, were to maintain a fair balance between bat and ball, to ma ke the Laws easier to \\nunderstand,  to safeguard players’ welfare, and to give umpires more mechanisms to address \\ninstances of  poor behaviour by players. Those principles have continued to guide this third \\nedition, in which changes are intended to shape the game of cricket as it should be played, \\nrather than being reliant on outdated, if long -standing, traditions. With that in mind, for the \\nfirst time in 2017, the Laws were written in a gender -neutral format,  reflecting, and further \\nencouraging,  the rising  popularity  of the game  amongst  women  and girls. This edition goes a \\nstep further, replacing the old term ‘batsman’ with the gender -neutral ‘batter’ – reflecting that \\ncricket is a game for everyone, and that language shapes our behaviours.  \\n \\nThe MCC Laws of  Cricket provide the framework  around which all  cricket  matches are  \\nbased.  Individual leagues and governing bodies then add their  own playing regulations on  \\ntop, amending the Laws to suit the differing needs of, for example, matches in junior cricket,  \\nT20 matches and Test matches. In almost all cases, the fundamentals of the game, such as  \\nscoring  runs and  taking  wickets,  remain  unchanged  in such regulations.  \\n \\nThe Laws contained in this book are correct  at the time of its publication but the MCC  \\nwebsite ( www.lords.org ) and Laws of Cricket App provide a digital version which will be  \\nupdated  with any minor  changes,  if necessary.  \\n \\nSignificant dates  in the history  of the Laws  are as follows:  \\n \\n1700  Cricket was  recognised as  early as  this date.  \\n1744  The earliest  known  Code  was drawn  up by certain  “Noblemen  and Gentlemen”  who \\nused the Artillery  Ground  in London.  \\n1755  The Laws were revised  by “Several  Cricket Clubs,  particularly the Star and  Garter in  \\nPall Mall”.  \\n1774  A further  revision  was produced  by “a Committee  of Noblemen  and Gentlemen  of \\nKent,  Hampshire,  Surrey,  Sussex,  Middlesex  and London at the  Star and Garter”.

The \\nmain changes were aimed at achieving clarification and better arrangement of the  Laws  \\nand their interpretations.  \\n1979  After  five editions of the 1947 Code, a further revision was begun in 1974 with the aim  \\nbeing to remove certain anomalies, consolidate various Amendments and Notes, and to  \\nachieve greater clarity and simplicity.  The new Code of Laws was approved at an  \\nMCC  Special  General  Meeting  on 21 November,  coming  into effect  in 1980.  \\n1992  A second edition of the 1980 Code was produced, incorporating all the amendments  \\nwhich  were  approved  during  the intervening  twelve  years.  \\n2000  A new Code  of Laws,  including  a Preamble  defining  the Spirit  of Cricket,  was \\napproved  on 3 May. \\n2007  MCC  established  the Laws  sub-committee,  replacing  the Laws  Working  Party.  \\n2010  A fourth edition of the 2000 Code was published.  MCC members agreed at a Special  \\nGeneral Meeting on 5 May that the MCC Committee is entitled to change the Laws of  \\nCricket  without  seeking  the approval  of the members.  \\n2017  After six Editions of the 2000 Code, a new 2017 Code came into effect on 1 October. A \\nsecond Edition was published in April  2019.  \\nMany queries on the Laws are sent to MCC for decision every year.  MCC, as the accepted  \\nCustodian  of the Laws,  has always  been  prepared  to answer  the queries  and to give \\ninterpretations.  However, MCC reserves the right not to answer queries which it considers to  \\nbe frivolous or connected  in any way with a bet or wager.  \\n \\nLord’s  Cricket  Ground             G.W.

The \\nboundary shall be the imaginary straight line on the ground joining the two nearest  \\nmarked  points.  \\n19.2.5   A boundary  that cannot  be identified  as in 19.2.2,  19.2.3  or 19.2.4  shall be \\ndetermined  by the umpires  before  the toss.  \\n19.2.6  An obstacle  within  the field of play,  other  than as in 19.2.7,  shall not be regarded  as \\na boundary unless so determined by the umpires before the toss.
